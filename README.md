## Introduction

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The **User Management System** is a web-based application designed to streamline user authentication, authorization, and account management. It provides a secure and efficient way to handle user registration, authentication, and role-based access control. 

Built with **Node.js** and **MySQL** for the backend and **Angular** for the frontend, this system ensures a seamless experience for both users and administrators. Key features include JWT authentication, email verification, password recovery, profile management, and an admin dashboard for managing user accounts. Additionally, a fake backend implementation is available to facilitate development and testing without requiring a live backend.
